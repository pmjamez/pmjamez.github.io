								<h2><B>Project Description</B></h2>


								<p>SEMI, a global trade association of Semiconductor companies, seeks to establish a comprehensive dashboard to aggregate and analyze water and waste data reported by its member companies. This project can be broken down into three steps: data retrieval, data extraction, and data presentation. This project aims to collect environmental data in the form of sustainability reports, consolidate that data, and present it for SEMI’s major stakeholders. 
</p>

								<h2><b>Project Proposal</b></h2>

								<ul>
									<li>
										<b>Solution: </b> The data extraction program will have the automated capability to retrieve PDF links, extract relevant fields from the PDFs, and output the relevant data. The project will deliver an interactive, intuitive PowerBI dashboard with capabilities including real-time updates, advanced analytic visualizations, and benchmark reporting. The project will produce complete documentation of the project development and final results, as well as a final presentation for project demonstration and handoff.
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>Tech Stack: </b> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Flask, AWS S3 Bucket via Heroku Bucketeer
									</li>
								</ul>

								

								<h2><b>Functional Scope</b></h2>

								<ul>
									<li>Develop a web-scraping bot that will grab the sustainability reports from each of the companies specified by project sponsor
									</li>
									<li>Develop a method for extracting information from these reports
									</li>
									<li>Develop a dashboard/analytics visualization
									</li>
								</ul>


								<h2><b>Non-Functional Scope</b></h2>

								<ul>
									<li>Perform visualizations on data for major stakeholders to view and pull insights from; since it is a trade association, it can be used to set environmental guidelines</li>
									<li>Make sure web-scraping bot pulls most updated information so that analytics are accurate for stakeholders
									</li>
									<li>Ensure PDF scanner extracts most accurate waste/water usage
									</li>
								</ul>

								<h1>Restaurant Reservation Manager</h1>

								<h2><b>Project Description</b></h2>
								<P>This was the final project for my Object Oriented Design Class at San Jose State University. Creating objects, classes, methods, and inheriting/extending classes/interfaces with principles such as 
									polymorphism, encapsulation, and multithreading were all considered. Working collaboratively as an Individual Contributor, making pull requests, and managing merge conflicts were all experiences I was glad to have with this project.</P>

								<h2><b>Project Proposal</b></h2>

								<ul>
									<li>
										<b>Problem:</b> Nowadays, making phone calls and manually keeping track in a notebook are the only ways to make bookings. When this happens, clients may have to wait to make reservations over the phone since it is busy. It may also be expensive and time-consuming to manually maintain track. Additionally, it takes time for consumers to phone the restaurant again in order to cancel their reservation.

									</li>
									<li>
									<b>Vision:</b> Create a seamless booking experience on the web for a private sushi pop-up.
									</li>
									<li><b>Domain:</b> The target audience would include the owner of the sushi pop-up, who wants to automate the booking process, as well as the customers who want to conveniently and save time when making a reservation.

									</li>
									<li><b>Tech Stack:</b> Java, Java Swing </li>
								</ul>

								<h3><b>Functionality</b></h3>
								<p>Users will be able to book reservations through a window, view the menu, and cancel reservations. The program should also keep track of booked reservations and make updates to reservations. 
								</p>

								<h3><b>High-level Description</b></h3>
								<p>Our plan is to create a reservation site that gives users the ability to create reservations at any local sushi restaurant without calling it in as well as managing the reservation for users who have a restaurant of their own. Specifically, users can use this site to choose the restaurant they would like to dine at and fill in all the needed information such as the time and size of their party. As for the owner, they can keep track of their customer’s name, phone number and the reserved table automatically just by opening up the site. Lastly, If the customers decide to cancel their reservation, they can simply do so through the site instead of calling the restaurant.
								</p>

								<p></p>

								<h2><b>Final Result:</b></h2>

								<P>After presenting our project to the class, our professor was impressed with the funcationality of our program. He was not expected the admin page to be able to view the reservation Objects created.
									My team and I thought long and hard about the user experience of this application, so we made sure to put in things like error messages to simulate what would happen to someone actually using this.
									In the end, we received an A on our project and came out with well earned experiences on collaborative coding and crafting user-centric designs.
								</P>
