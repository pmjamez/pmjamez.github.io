									Before I get to what I was working on, I really want to highlight the great times I had

										<strong>70%</strong>Time Saved
									</li>
									<li class="style3">
										<span class="icon solid fa-signal"></span>
										<strong>60+</strong> Business Units Impacted
									</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>Situation</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Context: Cisco is an enterprise networking hardware and software company. Since they don't manufacture any of their own products, their supply chain
										has to be robust and efficient in order to fulfull customer needs. 
									</li>
									<li>Because of Covid-19, an overwhelming amount of excess parts was left in inventory, with a value of $750 million towards Cisco's bottom line</li>
									<li>The department E&O (Excess and Obsolete) is in charge of handling the mitigation of these excess parts</li>
									<li>Due to the sheer volume, mitigation processes were taking longer, causing missed opportunities, and thus required solutions to help speed up their internal processes</li>
								</ul>
							
								<h3>Task</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>I was put on a team with 4 other interns with varying skills: Business Analysts, Data Analyst, and a Software Engineer in order to 
										develop a single source of truth for E&O Stakeholders
									</li>
									<li>I took the role of team leader and structured the project from an end-to-end solution. Furthermore, I contributed as an Individual Contributer, helping 
										the software engineer produce the tool.

										<strong>1</strong> New Stream Selection Strategy based on Market Portfolio Theory
									</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>Situation</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Cisco's Supply Chain uses a Forecasting AI based on decision Trees in order to predict the amount of demand of each Product Level ID</li>
									<li>Due to COVID-19, the AI was producing less than desirable results due to an influx of demand</li>
							
								
								</ul>
							
								<h3>Task</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Get an understanding of how the Forecasting AI works and what could be done to improve the current accuracy rating</li>
									<li>Research statisical methods to infer a more accurate prediction strategy</li>
									<li>Put simply, the Forecasting AI had multiple streams that would branch based on feature selection</li>
									<li>At the end of the stream, the path that a PLID would take would be the stream chosen for the AI</li>
							
								</ul>
								<h3>Action</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Instead of taking a single stream, I researched and tested the benefits of congregating multiple streams</li>
									<li>Backed by a financial analysis called Market Portfolio Theory and A/B Testing, I developed a strategy to take multiple streams and take 
										the mean of their results
									</li>
									<li>I wrote code in python that would handle this distribution and allocation and handed the analysis over to the Forecasting team for testing</li>
									
								</ul>
								
								<h3>Result</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>A 3% increase in forecasting accuracy over the FY22-FY23 timespan</li>
									<li>Presented findings to key stakeholders, showing impact to demand forecasting </li>
									<li>A rethinking in the stream selection process and how PLID's should be accounted for</li>

								<h2><b>Project 3: Documenting Process Flow for Cisco Meraki</b></h2>

								<h3>Situation</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Cisco Meraki's Supply Chain runs extremely efficiently, they have a 97% same or next day fulfillment rate due to their
										internal process flows.
									</li>
									<li>Cisco would like to emulate this level of success in their own Supply Chain Operations</li>
									<li>As the start of a long supply chain transformation, we lay the foundation by documenting Cisco Meraki's processes</li>
							
								</ul>
							
								<h3>Task</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Document Cisco Meraki's Supply Chain process flow across the 5 distribution centers</li>
									<li>Note the exact processes, from data communications and physical hand-offs</li>
							
									
								</ul>
								<h3>Action</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Group of 4 interns to handle their own process flow for their respectively assigned sites.</li>
									<li>Interview Supply Chain Managers from Cisco Meraki</li>
									<li>Created a barebones process flow model for the other interns to utilize</li>
								
								</ul>
								
								<h3>Result</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Mapped the supply chain process flows for Cisco Meraki</li>
									<li>Discovered Key Insights into the 97% same/next day fulfillment rate</li>
									<li>Laid the foundation for Cisco's supply chain transformation</li>

									Working at Jabil really opened my eyes to the field of software development and how to navigate a large company 
									structure. I was brought on board a bit later than the rest of the intern cohort, but here is where I learned to be a 
									self-starter and to do things on my own. This is the attitude I carried with my to Cisco and why I took on the stretch assignments

								<h2><b>Project 1: Migration to new MES Software</b></h2>
								<ul class="statistics">
									<li class="style1">
										<span class="icon solid fa-dollar-sign"></span>
										<strong>20000+</strong> Facility Assets
									</li>
									<li class="style2">
										<span class="icon fa-clock"></span>
										<strong>33%</strong>Time Saved
									</li>
									
								</ul>

								<h3>Situation</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>For context, this Jabil location specialized in CNC manufacturing and milling</li>
									<li>As such, my manager was brought on board for a maintenance and facilities transformation.</li>
									<li>Part of this transformation was updating the MES (Manufacturing Execution System) from their legacy software to
										the Critical Manufacturing MES.
									</li>
								
								</ul>
							
								<h3>Task</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>In order to assist with this, my task was to ensure the quality data migration of facility assets across the Livermore and Fremont Jabil Sites

									</li>
									<li>This task involved creating data maps in adherece to the CM MES (Critical Manufacturing MES) software</li>
									<li>Sorting through several large collections of excel files that listed facilities maintenance, I was responsible for mapping the assets according to predefined structure</li>
								
								</ul>
								<h3>Action</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>There I was, on Excel, mapping the assets that ranged from lightbulbs and outlets to each room, within each subsection, and within each facility</li>
									<li>I tested the validity of the data uploads within the CM MES software</li>
									<li>For any discrepencies, I scheduled user facing interviews with shop workers to determine a data schema for how assets would be labelled</li>
									<li>This was because the floor workers would routinely have to upload information into the MES, so I wanted to get their input</li>
							
								</ul>
								<h3>Result</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Accomplishing my task quicker than expected, I delivered a coherent and validated data map and schema of the facility assets</li>
									<li>This task and subsequent subtasks assisted the Facilitys and Preventative Maintenance Manager in his efforts for the facilities transformation</li>

										<strong>25%</strong>Productivity Increase
									</li>
									
								</ul>

								<h3>Situation</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Given that I had accomplished my main project earlier than expected, I had made friends with the software development team 
										at Jabil.
									</li>
									<li>They were working on building an internal Project Management Software that aligned closely with the facilities transformation</li>
									<li>Naturally, I had asked how I could contribute to this exciting project, given that I was a project management intern</li>
								
								</ul>
							
								<h3>Task</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Assist in the development of three main features, including the Ticket Issuing System, Dyanmic Project Timeline, and Employee verificaiton with the Okta Sessions API</li>
									<li>Create Product Requirement Documents, create a product roadmap, and manage the backlog</li>
								
								</ul>
								<h3>Action</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Given my previous experience with Jira, I had a good idea of where to start</li>
									<li>Researching the standards and formats of Product Requirement Documents, I had to get familiar with the principles of Agile Software Development</li>
									<li>Using my past experiences however, it was natural completing these tasks as I already had a solid foundation</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>Result</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>In the end, I delievered the necessary deliverables I was assigned in order to assist with the development and launch of this project</li>
									<li>Near the end of my internship, I was able to see the product demo of the features I had assisted with, which was completed with an increase in productivity due to my contributions</li>

								<h2>First time being in the "real" workforce</h2>
								<p> 
									Over the course of fall to winter 2021, I had the opportunity to work as a contract manufacturing technician for 
									two start-ups. This coupled with the reunion of my old friend had sparked some passion for me to get industry experience. 
									I first started doing contract work at Ultima Genomics, where I was also surrounded by talented and young engineers. I was a sponge,
									absorbing all the knowledge I could of their words of wisdom. This is where I learned how to think on your feet, make 
									quick but effective decisions, and operate within an extremely fast paced environment. 
								</p>

								<h2>Stepping away from work</h2>
								
								<p>
									Working at Mill was also a pleasure. Mill was founded by ex-Google employees so it was extremely insightful talking to them
									about why they decided to leave and start their own company. It was refreshing to see the passion and spark in someone's eyes 
									when they were talking about something they were truly passionate about. I also hit it off with the people behind Mill (was even offered
									a technician role), but during this point of my life, I decided to step away from technician work and really focus in on taking 
									the CS courses offered by community college. Within one semester, I had filled out the CS minor requirements by taking intro to CS, 
									data structures and algorithms, discrete math, and calculus. That summer after the semester had ended is when I started working at Jabil. Despite 
									the offer, it was at this point where I had decided where my future career goals would lie.
