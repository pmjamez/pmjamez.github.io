								<h1>Cisco</h1>
								<p>Interning as Cisco was a life-changing experience. 
								</p>
								<div class="image-container">
									<div class = "image main">
										<img class = "image2" src="images/ciscoimage1.jpg" alt="" />
									</div>
									<div class = "image main">
										<img class = "image2" src="images/ciscoimage2.jpg" alt="" />
									</div>
								</div>
								
								<p>
									I grew so much interning at Cisco. My interpersonal, soft, technical, problem solving, and time management skills all saw a considerable growth spurt.
									I was surrounded by so many talented, passionate, and supportive people. Although I learned many lessons, the number one 
									thing that I learned is to create a voice for myself and to ask for what I want.


								</p>
								<h2>Bringing People Together</h2>
								<P>Before I get to what I was working on, I really want to highlight the great times I had 
									with the intern cohort. Work is work obviously, but I think it's equally important to have fun 
									and connect with others at work. It's safe to say my summer at Cisco was a summer I will never forget. 
									I went sky-diving, became an Intern Ambassador, and most importantly, I woke up everyday looking forward
									to my day. 
								</P>

								<h2>Projects</h2>
								<P>I worked on several projects when I was at Cisco. The way the intern program is structured is that interns have
									a main project with the option of taking on several stretch assignments. This was no different for me. 
								</P>
								<p>
									Although my title may say otherwise, the projects I took on required the skills of a software engineer, data scientist, and analyst. 
									My main project was based on a case study. At a base level, Cisco's business is selling enterprise level networking hardware and software.
									Since Cisco outsources all of their manufacturing to third parties, they have a lot of people in Supply Chain to make sure all the processes
									run smoothly. 
								</p>
								<h2>Project 1: Internal Dashboard Tool for Excess and Obsolete</h2>
								<P>To put it simply, a lot of processes for mitigating excess and obsolete parts were extremely manual. The crux of the issue was that
									major stakeholders would often miss out on major opportunities to mitigate parts because they would take so much time gathering and 
									analyzing information. 

									Since my job title is "Project Manager" and my career goals are to move into product, I wanted to structure this project 
									to how a product team would ship a product in the real world. So this means having excellent stakeholder management, adhering to the SDLC, 
									conducting market research, and most importantly, creating something of value for Cisco. 

									Now I may not be able to describe too much in detail, my tool was built in a two step process of automating
									the gathering of data and then automating the analysis portion of it. I directly wanted to tackle the crux of the issue and highlighted that
									when I presented the product with my team on Cisco Live TV. 
								</P>
								<h2>Project 2: Increasing Accurcy of Demand Forecasting AI</h2>
								<p>Now there have already been talks about how large companies are starting to implement AI into their 
									work structure, and Cisco is no different. This project was a stretch assignment of mine that I wanted to take on
									to learn more about AI and the underlying processes behind it. Other interns had stretch assignments of building
									AI chatbots for the Cisco website, but I really wanted to understand how AI/ML worked. 
									I don't traditionally come from a data science or statistics background, but I was really interested
									and so this project was where I really took on the attitude of asking for what I want. 
								</p>
								<h2>Project 3: Documenting Process Flow for Cisco Meraki</h2>
								<P>This project was near the end of my internship, but also involved major stakeholders. Essentially, this project consisted of 
									conducting internal research on Cisco Meraki's supply chain, mapping out the process flows, and making comparisons against 
									Cisco's own flows. I pointed out where the differences lied and how either company could improve processes within
									their respective supply chains.
								</P>

								<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
									<ul>
										<li>Don't be afraid to ask for help</li>
										<li>Always keep others in mind</li>
										<li>Giving updates and showing empathy matters</li>
										<li>Market yourself and connect with others</li>
									</ul>

								<h1>Jabil</h1>
								<p> 
									Working at Jabil really opened my eyes to the field of software development and how to navigate a large company 
									structure. I was brought on board a bit later than the rest of the intern cohort, but here is where I learned to be a 
									self-starter and to do things on my own. This is the attitude I carried with my to Cisco and why I took on the stretch assignments 
									that I did. 
								</p>
								<p>
									No one at Jabil was expecting me to help out with this project. The migration to the new ERP was my only responsiblity, but during my breaks I would 
									wander around the building. Since I started a bit later, I wasn't as close with the initial intern cohort, but I still made small talk from 
									time to time. Anyway, this one day as I was wandering, I noticed a couple of mechanical keyboards poking out of the door. It was a hobby I had 
									recently picked up and from the glance I had, they looked like really nice keyboards. From there, I made friends with the software development manager and asked 
									what project he was working on. We hit if off immediately and not long after, I found myself immersed with the experience I had been seeking. 
								</p>
								<h2>Project 1: Migration to new MES</h2>
								<p>This was my main project, which was ensuring quality data migration of the transition of the new MES (Manufacturing Execution System) which was tied to their existing ERP. 
									I was brought on board for 6 weeks, in which my manager didn't expect to finish as he had scheduled this part of the project to be 9 weeks. I had created data maps for 
								the facility assets and how that would be translated into the new MES and cleaned the data of redudancies.  </p>
								<h2>Project 2: Feature Launch of Internal Software</h2>
								<p>Since the product being built was an internal software and the development team was small, it was a lot easier to brainstorm ideas and get the ball rolling.
									It was really cool to get the chance to work on something that would be used by the individuals I would be interacting with. I managed the development and launch
								of three features for their internal project management software, implementing employee verification with Okta Sessions API, creating a dyanmic timeline where you can block 
								tasks, and a ticket issuing system akin to Jira. </p>
								<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
									<ul>
										<li>Don't be afraid to start conversations with people outside of your business function</li>
										<li>Make yourself stand out by going the extra mile!</li>
										
										
									</ul>

								<h2>First time being in the "real" workforce</h2>
								<p> 
									Over the course of fall to winter 2021, I had the opportunity to work as a contract manufacturing technician for 
									two start-ups. This coupled with the reunion of my old friend had sparked some passion for me to get industry experience. 
									I first started doing contract work at Ultima Genomics, where I was also surrounded by talented and young engineers. I was a sponge,
									absorbing all the knowledge I could of their words of wisdom. This is where I learned how to think on your feet, make 
									quick but effective decisions, and operate within an extremely fast paced environment. 
								</p>

								<h2>Stepping away from work</h2>
								
								<p>
									Working at Mill was also a pleasure. Mill was founded by ex-Google employees so it was extremely insightful talking to them
									about why they decided to leave and start their own company. It was refreshing to see the passion and spark in someone's eyes 
									when they were talking about something they were truly passionate about. I also hit it off with the people behind Mill (was even offered
									a technician role), but during this point of my life, I decided to step away from technician work and really focus in on taking 
									the CS courses offered by community college. Within one semester, I had filled out the CS minor requirements by taking intro to CS, 
									data structures and algorithms, discrete math, and calculus. That summer after the semester had ended is when I started working at Jabil. Despite 
									the offer, it was at this point where I had decided where my future career goals would lie.
