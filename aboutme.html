							<h2>My Story and Journey</h2>
							<p>One gloomy afternoon, I had reunited with a childhood friend. This person who I played in the park with until it was dark was now a software engineering intern after 5 years.
								At this point in my life around December 2021, I wasn't sure what I was doing with an associate degree in business, but as we were in that same park 5 years ago, he was giving me guidance.
								He was telling me about his daily life at work and just how much fun he was having. This confused me as I was surprised someone could enjoy the idea of work 
								so much! After the sky turned to night and we had to split ways again, he sent me home with some advice to just try an introductry coding class. From there I took
								as many classes as my community college had to offer, got an internship, and haven't looked back! 
							</p>
							<p>I'm always looking to learn more and keep expanding my knowledge. Next items on my list are to finish my AWS certification, learn how to use Docker/Kubernetes in a project, 
								and create clear and concise documentation of all my projects. 
							</p>

								<h2>Hobbies</h2>
								<p>Besides making sushi, I also love to build computers, run, lift weights, keyboards, and max out credit card points. I also love to cook 
									other foods as well! 
								</p>
								
								
								<h2>The coveted Sushi photos!</h2>
								<p>Honestly, I'm not entirely sure when the exact moment I decided I wanted to start learning how to make Sushi was. When I was a kid
									growing up, my mom would always stir fry beef and onions and we would eat it with rice and a packet of snack seaweed. Since 
									Sushi wasn't such a budget friendly option, the occasional stir fry beef and onions would evolve from packets of seaweed to whole nori wraps.
									Kind of like the saying "we have sushi at home", my mom tried her best to get us to eat our food as children.

										<img class = "image2" src="images/sushi2.jpg" alt="" />
									</div>
								</div>
								<p>Growing into an adult with my own money mixed with the free time during the pandemic, I just wanted to experiment with something new. I had always 
									been enamored with cooking and by 
									this point in my life, I had a solid foundation for cooking skills; however, 
									there is something to be said about making Sushi. How Japanese people have dedicated such
									an artform out of seasoned rice, roasted seaweed, and the freshest ingredients.

								<h2>What I'm currently working on! </h2>
								<p>Right now, I have a few projects in mind that I want to execute. 
									The most common piece of advice I give out to those who want to build their experiences 
									and resumes is to focus on the "personal" aspect of a personal project. Have connection and some level 
									of passion as to why you're building a website or 
									game. Have some backstory, some character, make it PERSONAL! 

								</p>
								<p>With that being said, the next personal project would be a reservation site for my upcoming Sushi Business. 
									I have been giving this idea some thought for a long time, as I often get complimented on the quality of my Sushi, 
									accompanied by quesitons on commercializing it. I do not think I would ever start a pop-up restaurant, but hosting private
									dinners sounds more appealing. This idea could use a website that would make it seamless for interested
									individuals who want to try my sushi! 
								</p>
								<p>Given my previous experiences, I really want to structure this project like a product launch.
								</p>
